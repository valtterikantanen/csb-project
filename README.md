The app presents multiple security vulnerabilities, aligning with the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) list of prevalent security risks. A detailed examination of these vulnerabilities is provided [here](./essay.md).

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:valtterikantanen/csb-project.git
    cd csb-project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it

    ```bash

    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    You can deactivate the virtual environment at any time by running `deactivate`.

3. Install the dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up a local database and optionally populate it with [sample data](/src/pages/fixtures/sample.json)

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    python3 manage.py loaddata sample
    ```

5. Start the development server
