      "review_text": "A classic piece of literature that paints a vivid picture of the Roaring Twenties. Fitzgerald's portrayal of the disillusionment and excess of that era is both intriguing and heartbreaking. Every character, from Jay Gatsby to Daisy Buchanan, is deeply flawed yet utterly compelling. The writing style is rich and poetic, making it a joy to read.",
